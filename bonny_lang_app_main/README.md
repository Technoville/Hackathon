Notes:
This Progress Web App (PWA) was strictly designed for mobile devices, as there was no time to plan for the desktop UI.
Also some features of the app were not implemented, hopefully everything would be done in the next version.
We planned on using backend but, we had a technical problem, so the backend code wasn't included.
